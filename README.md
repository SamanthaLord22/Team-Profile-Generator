# Team-Profile-Generator
For this assignment I created a Team Profile Generator.
When I enter node index.js in the terminal, a series of questions to create Team Profile Generator are prompted to the user.
The questions ask for the name, title, employee id, email address, and github username.
The user answers are then generated into text in a index.html file that can be viewed in the browser.
